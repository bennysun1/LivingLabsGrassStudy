# Living Laboratory Grass Study
## Overview
This project explores the intersection of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and Scientific Ecological Knowledge (SEK) through the automated measurement of grass lay angles using the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm. By analyzing images of grass, we aim to enhance our understanding of Alaskan indigenous wisdom and its relationship with modern scientific findings.

## Data Sources
We collected images from:

* Google Images: Basic geometric shapes and diagonal lines.
* Mapbox: Aerial cityscapes (e.g., San Francisco, Salt Lake City, Detroit) to test urban structure identification.
* St. Lawrence Universityâ€™s Living Laboratory: Aerial and close-up images of grass, ensuring consistent orientation with a manually rotated north indicator.
* Complex image of a skier doing a backflip in front of a crowd students at St. Lawrence University's Titus weekend.
