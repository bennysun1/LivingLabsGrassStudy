|       In Alaska, indigenous hunters and gatherers have long observed the alignment of grass and plants after the growing season as indicative of prevailing wind directions and shifts. Due to the remote and harsh conditions, traditional weather stations are absent to measure shifts in historically predominant wind directions. In a previous study Dr. Jon Rosales (Environmental Studies) and his team collected images of grass lay from St. Lawrence Island, Alaska, and manually attempted to measure grass lay angles. This project investigated the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm to automate this process. We applied the algorithm to various images of grass fields sampled from the internet to test its viability.
